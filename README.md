# keyboardReader
im the master procrastinator

just reads ur keyboard and spits out relevant info at the end (cmd + shift + esc, press and hold only these 3 buttons)
info will be stored in a sepreate file (should be in place as the program file) called "keyInfo.txt"
only works on mac (bc i use mac)

btw this is a side project so i didnt bother making it look good
if some cmd shift and esc have 0.00s pressed thats bc they were only used for ending the program
if theres some weird keys thats bc those keys arent supported (they dont have a formal name)

doesnt steal ur info i promise
also uh i will add the needed dependicies its just that its 3 am and i havent even tested this yet
